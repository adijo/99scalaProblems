# 99 Scala Problems.

A repository that contains my solutions to problems taken from [here.](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

> These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at 
  the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland.

# Content

* Lists (Linked lists)
  * Get the last element of a list. 
  * Get the penultimate element of a list.
  * Get the nth element of a list.
  * Get the length of a list.
  * Generate a list containing elements from `start` to `end.`
  * Reverse a list. 
  * Insert an element at a given position in a list.
  * Remove a given element from a list.
  * Remove a given element from a list and return the list.
  * Randomly select `k` elements from a list.
  * Check if a list is a palindrome.
  * Split a list based on an input pivot.
  * Flatten a nested list.
  * Compress a list. If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced with a single copy of the element.
  * Pack a list. If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists.
  * Run-length encoding of a list.
  * Drop every `nth` element from a list.
  * Given two indices, I and K, the slice is the list containing the elements from and including the Ith element up to but not including the Kth element of the original list. Start counting the elements with 0.
  * Rotate a list.
  * Merge sort a list.
  * Draw N different random numbers from the set `[1, M]`
  * Deep reverse a list.
  
* Binary Trees
  * Count number of leaves in a tree.
  * Get a string representation of a tree.
  * Get all the leaves of the tree.
  * Get all the internal nodes of a tree.
  * Get all nodes at a particular level.
  * Check if a tree is symmetric.
  * Layout of a tree.
  * Check if a tree is balanced.
  * Generate a forest of completely balanced binary trees.
  
* Multiway Trees
  * Get the node count of a multi-way tree.
  * We define the internal path length of a multiway tree as the total sum of the path lengths from the root to all nodes of the tree. By this definition, the tree in the figure of problem P70 has an internal path length of 9. Write a method internalPathLength to return that sum.
  * There is a particular notation for multiway trees in Lisp. Lisp is a prominent functional programming language. In Lisp almost everything is a list. Convert a binary tree into its lispy notation.
  * Construct a multi-way tree from its string notation. Example: `afg^^c^bd^e^^^` to a tree.
  * Postorder traveral of a multi-way tree.
  
* Logic
  * Huffman encoding.
  * Logical functions.
  
* Arithmetic
  * Min.
  * Max.
  * GCD.
